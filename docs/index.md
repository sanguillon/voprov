Overview
========

VOprov is a library based on the W3C prov package that provides a Python structure to store provenance information that follows the IVOA Provenance Data Model. The provenance records may then be exported as files (supporting PROV-N, PROV-XML, PROV-JSON export, as well as graphical exports).

Tutorial

A tutorial to build a provenance graph is available here:
